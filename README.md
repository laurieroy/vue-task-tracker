# Task Tracker
This is practice project using Vue3, running through Traversy Media's [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZXt1Aom3Cs&t=5413s).

* User clicks green 'Add Task' button, opening a form. Add task name and date. If set a reminder, a green border shows on the left of the task. The name is required. 

* User clicks the red 'close' to hide the form.

* User can del the task by clicking the red x.

* User can toggle the set a reminder by double clicking anywhere on the task.
